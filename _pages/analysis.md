**NOTICE: Draft.**  As of August 9, 2016 this analysis is ongoing.

The *gh-impact* dataset is currently being explored and results will be posted here.

## How does one score compare to the population?

First, be sure to read [these caveats regarding comparison](/pages/answers.html#are-gh-impact-scores-comparable-between-two-users-or-two-industries), because there are a few reasons why scores might not be directly comparable.

Nevertheless, it is easy to see where one score falls on the distribution.  Here is a histogram showing how many accounts have a certain number of stars.

### Percentiles

Another way to think about this comparison is to ask the question: what percentage of accounts have fewer stars?

For all the people with a *gh-impact* score of 1, they have more stars than nobody; 1 is the lowest you can go and still have a *gh-impact* score.  All accounts on GitHub start with a *gh-impact* score. Unless accounts take some action, their score will remain 0, and on this basis all inactive accounts have been removed.

<!-- ## is there a substantial difference between individuals and organizations? -->

<!-- ## is there a relationship between **gh-impact** and number of followers? -->

<!-- ## is there any effect of language upon gh-impact? -->

<!-- ## is **gh-impact** predictive of the popularity of a users's projects? -->
