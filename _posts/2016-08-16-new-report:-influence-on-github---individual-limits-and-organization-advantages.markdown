I've released a preliminary report called [Influence on GitHub - Individual Limits and Organization Advantages](/report/).  Here's the abstract:

> *gh-impact* is a new measure of influence on GitHub. In this paper, we introduce *gh-impact* and use it to examine differences between Individual and Organizational GitHub accounts. Among our key findings, we find *gh-impact* increases as the size of organizations increase, suggesting that individuals may have a comparative disadvantage. We also find evidence for a ceiling effect of the impact of Individuals. While some individuals manage extremely successful projects, it is rare to find Individuals who manage multiple projects of a similar caliber. Organizations are not inherently resource- bound and can sustain many projects in parallel, leading to greater overall work impact and a correspondingly higher *gh-impact* score.

I also plan to publish shorter blog posts that dig into individual effects.  The current report is pretty dense; everything had to fit within 2 pages.  There's so much more to say about it all that I simply require more words.
